## How to Play Mega Tic Tac Toe

Mega Tic Tac Toe, also known as Super Tic Tac Toe, is an advanced version of the traditional Tic Tac Toe game. Here are the rules to play:

1. **Game Board**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid of Tic Tac Toe boards, making a total of 9 smaller boards within a larger board.

2. **Objective**: The goal is to win three smaller boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the overall game.

3. **Starting the Game**: Player X starts the game by placing their mark (X) on any cell of any of the 9 smaller boards.

4. **Subsequent Moves**: The position of the mark in the smaller board determines the next smaller board where the opponent must play. For example, if Player X places their mark in the top-right cell of a smaller board, Player O must play in the top-right smaller board.

5. **Winning a Smaller Board**: A player wins a smaller board by getting three of their marks in a row within that board, similar to traditional Tic Tac Toe rules.

6. **Winning the Game**: The first player to win three smaller boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

7. **Draw**: If all cells in a smaller board are filled and no player has won that board, it is considered a draw. If all smaller boards are drawn and no player has won three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

8. **Strategy**: Players must think ahead and plan their moves carefully, as each move determines the next board for the opponent.
